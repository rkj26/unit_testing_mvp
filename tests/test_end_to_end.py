"""The whole chain in one walk: `build_dataset.py` → `Dataset` → four protocols → `get_records()`.

This file replaces five per-module test files. What it keeps from them are the assertions no single
module can make alone, because the defects this rewrite exists to prevent all live where two modules
meet: a split that stops travelling after the first protocol, a trigger run whose inputs the next
protocol cannot find, an abstention that reaches a threshold sweep as a `0.0` the monitor never gave,
a suite scored on the wrong candidate's search space, a trusted program recorded without anything
saying whether it works, and a resumed run that writes a candidate into a denominator twice.

Nothing here reaches a provider or Docker. `resolve` is replaced with a scripted client under all
three spellings — `tm` and `solve` imported the name, the other two reach it through the module, and
patching one and not the others leaves a protocol calling the real endpoint — and `sandbox.run_raw`
is replaced with a canned grid. The model string is `mockllm/...` besides, so a call site this file
missed returns `model._MOCK` rather than spending money.

The one exception is `TrustedSolve`'s grid, which runs the REAL harness under `Isolation.SUBPROCESS`:
the double replaces Docker there, not our own code. Its property is the oracle — an expected-output
table we write, embed in the harness and read back inside the container — so a canned grid would
assert against nothing and could not see a table the harness cannot key into.

Most tests here drive `write_config()` then `execute()` — exactly what the subprocess runs — with a
scripted client, because a tmux subprocess is a fresh interpreter where no monkeypatch of ours
exists. The last test drives the real `Run.run()` instead, on `mockllm/model`: `TrustedModel` short
-circuits any name starting with `mock` to a canned answer before any network call, so the whole
path — `config.json`, tmux, a rebuilt class in another interpreter, `records.jsonl` — is exercised
for nothing. That test is the only coverage `launch.py` has, and it is worth more than a unit test
of the launcher, because what breaks is never the tmux call: it is the subprocess failing to rebuild
the run from its own config.
