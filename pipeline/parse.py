"""Turning one completion into the two things a protocol can run: test source, and trigger inputs.

`read_input_lines` is the single place a line becomes a value; both the search space and the
dropped-input diagnostic read it, so an explanation cannot disagree with the parse it explains.
Both parsers are tolerant, and a shortened search space is not an error — so the count of inputs
lost travels with the space rather than a bare flag.
