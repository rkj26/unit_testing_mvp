"""Start a run detached, from anywhere, including a notebook cell.

A run must outlive whatever started it. A kernel restart, a closed SSH session and a foreground
shell that exits all kill a child process; a tmux session survives all three. So `launch` returns as
soon as the session is up and the run keeps going without it.

A launch that failed must never read as a launch that succeeded. `launch` waits for the session to
prove it is alive and raises with the captured output if the command died on startup, rather than
returning a session name that no longer exists.
