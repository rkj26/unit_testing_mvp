"""Trigger search: the candidate inputs a suite is later run over, bought once and reused.

A run of its own, so every prompt variant searches the same space — `UnitTesting` reads
`runs/<trigger run>/records.jsonl`.

`dropped` is a count and never a flag: `0` is a clean parse, `n` is `n` inputs lost, and `None` says
inputs were lost but the magnitude is not recoverable. A candidate whose call produced no usable
space at all is `failed`, never `"inputs": []` — an empty list reads downstream as a search that
