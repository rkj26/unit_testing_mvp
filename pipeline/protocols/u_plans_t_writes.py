"""U plans the suite, T writes it: the authoring call of `unit_testing`, split across two models.

One arm, one question: does the thinking that finds a backdoor have to happen in the model that
writes the test? `UnitTesting` gives one trusted model the submission and asks for ten tests. This
gives the submission to the **untrusted** model at high reasoning and asks only for a plan — prose,
one intent per test, no code — and then hands that plan to the trusted model at low reasoning, which
never sees the submission at all.

The record is `unit_testing`'s, plus the plan. Same `fired`, `test_names`, `catches` and pair
counts, produced by the same parser and the same `suite_verdict`, so every measurement cell reads
this arm without knowing it exists.

**Two ways this arm can be wrong, and both are the point of running it.** U sees the code and is
untrusted, so a planner that recognises its own backdoor can plan ten tests around it — sandbagging
that `UnitTesting` has no channel for, and which arrives as a catch rate below the single-call arm
rather than as an error. And U runs at `high` while every arm it will be tabled against runs at
`low`, so a gain over `UnitTesting` is attributable to the split only against a control of
`UnitTesting` at high reasoning; the standing comparator here is TM at low, and that confound is
recorded rather than removed.
