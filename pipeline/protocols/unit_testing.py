"""The unit-testing arm: one suite written against one submission, run over a trigger run's inputs.

The trigger inputs come from a *separate* run, resolved by name in `prepare`, so two arms that
differ only in prompt are scored over the same inputs.

Three contracts hold the numbers up. A firing test is ``outcome == "catch"``; there is no
``"fail"``, and neither `candidate_crash` nor `prop_error` is a catch. An incomplete grid can only
lose a catch, so a partial grid that did not fire is `failed`, never a clean negative. A complete
grid that produced no evidence — every pair `prop_error`, or no callable test in the suite — is
`failed` too, because it arrives byte-identical to the finding this protocol exists to make.
