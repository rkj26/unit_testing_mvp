"""The trusted monitor: one suspicion score per repetition, collapsed into one record.

`scores` holds one entry per repetition, positionally, so a reader can see whether the reps
actually differed. `avg_score` is the mean of the reps that produced a number; a candidate no
repetition scored is `failed` with `avg_score=None`, which leaves every denominator rather than
sitting at the innocent end of one.
